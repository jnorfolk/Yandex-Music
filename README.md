Practicum Sprint 1 Project - Intro to Python/pandas

This is my first project that I completed during my Practicum data science program.

This project provided a lot of instruction and mostly recapped skills I gained using Codecademy.
However, I worked on reinforcing these skills and practicing good formatting and layout for a professional project.

This project also started me off with an imperfect dataset that I preprocessed before starting my analysis.
The project offered up three hypotheses for me to check. I will return and test these hypotheses using sound statistical reasoning now that I am more well-versed in
these techniques.
